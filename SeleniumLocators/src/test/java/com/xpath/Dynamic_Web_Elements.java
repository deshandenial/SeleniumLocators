   * In our test automation codes, we generally prefer to use id, name, class, etc. these kinds of locators. 
   * However, sometimes we could not find any of them in the DOM and also sometimes locators of some elements change dynamically in the DOM.
   * In these kinds of situations, we need to use smart locators. 
   * These locators must be capable to locate complex and dynamically changing web elements.
